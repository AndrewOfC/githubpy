If found:<br><br>  **Inner loop**:<br>  * Delete the identified analysis.<br>  * Parse the response for the value of `confirm_delete_url` and, if found, use this in the next iteration.<br><br>The above process assumes that you want to remove all trace of the tool's analyses from the GitHub user interface, for the specified repository, and it therefore uses the `confirm_delete_url` value. Alternatively, you could use the `next_analysis_url` value, which would leave the last analysis in each set undeleted to avoid removing a tool's analysis entirely.|

For more information on working with pagination, see "[Traversing with pagination](/rest/guides/traversing-with-pagination)."<br><br>When calling this API without any paging parameters (`per_page` or `page`), the returned list is limited to 250 commits and the last commit in the list is the most recent of the entire comparison. When a paging parameter is specified, the first commit in the returned list of each page is the earliest.<br><br>**Signature verification object**<br><br>The response will include a `verification` object that describes the result of verifying the commit's signature.

At GitHub Enterprise Server we often deploy branches and verify them<br>before we merge a pull request.<br><br>The `environment` parameter allows deployments to be issued to different runtime environments.

This parameter<br>makes it easier to track which environments have requested deployments. The default environment is `production`.<br><br>The `auto_merge` parameter is used to ensure that the requested ref is not behind the repository's default branch. If<br>the ref _is_ behind the default branch for the repository, we will attempt to merge it for you. If the merge succeeds,<br>the API will return a successful merge commit. If merge conflicts prevent the merge from succeeding, the API will<br>return a failure response.<br><br>By default, [commit statuses](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.3/rest/reference/repos#statuses) for every submitted context must be in a `success`<br>state.

For more details about how to receive highlighted search results, see [Text match metadata](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.3/rest/reference/search#text-match-metadata).<br><br>For example, if you want to find the definition of the `addClass` function inside [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery) repository, your query would look something like this:<br><br>`q=addClass+in:file+language:js+repo:jquery/jquery`<br><br>This query searches for the keyword `addClass` within a file's contents. The query limits the search to files where the language is JavaScript in the `jquery/jquery` repository.<br><br>#### Considerations for code search<br><br>Due to the complexity of searching code, there are a few restrictions on how searches are performed:<br><br>*   Only the _default branch_ is considered. In most cases, this will be the `master` branch.<br>*   Only files smaller than 384 KB are searchable.<br>*   You must always include at least one search term when searching source code. For example, searching for [`language:go`](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=language%3Ago&type=Code) is not valid, while [`amazing<br>language:go`](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=amazing+language%3Ago&type=Code) is.|
|[SearchCommits(q, sort=None, direction='desc', per\_page=30, page=1)](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.3/rest/reference/search#search-commits)|Find commits via various criteria on the default branch (usually `master`). This method returns up to 100 results [per page](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.3/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#pagination).<br><br>When searching for commits, you can get text match metadata for the **message** field when you provide the `text-match` media type. For more details about how to receive highlighted search results, see [Text match<br>metadata](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.3/rest/reference/search#text-match-metadata).<br><br>For example, if you want to find commits related to CSS in the [octocat/Spoon-Knife](https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife) repository. Your query would look something like this:<br><br>`q=repo:octocat/Spoon-Knife+css`|
|[SearchIssuesAndPullRequests(q, sort=None, direction='desc', per\_page=30, page=1)](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.3/rest/reference/search#search-issues-and-pull-requests)|Find issues by state and keyword. This method returns up to 100 results [per page](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.3/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#pagination).<br><br>When searching for issues, you can get text match metadata for the issue **title**, issue **body**, and issue **comment body** fields when you pass the `text-match` media type. For more details about how to receive highlighted<br>search results, see [Text match metadata](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.3/rest/reference/search#text-match-metadata).<br><br>For example, if you want to find the oldest unresolved Python bugs on Windows. Your query might look something like this.<br><br>`q=windows+label:bug+language:python+state:open&sort=created&order=asc`<br><br>This query searches for the keyword `windows`, within any open issue that is labeled as `bug`. The search runs across repositories whose primary language is Python. The results are sorted by creation date in ascending order, which means the oldest issues appear first in the search results.<br><br>**Note:** For [user-to-server](https://docs.github.com/developers/apps/identifying-and-authorizing-users-for-github-apps#user-to-server-requests) GitHub App requests, you can't retrieve a combination of issues and pull requests in a single query. Requests that don't include the `is:issue` or `is:pull-request` qualifier will receive an HTTP `422 Unprocessable Entity` response. To get results for both issues and pull requests, you must send separate queries for issues and pull requests. For more information about the `is` qualifier, see "[Searching only issues or pull requests](https://docs.github.com/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-only-issues-or-pull-requests)."|

For more details about how to receive highlighted search results, see [Text match metadata](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.3/rest/reference/search#text-match-metadata).<br><br>For example, if you want to find labels in the `linguist` repository that match `bug`, `defect`, or `enhancement`. Your query might look like this:<br><br>`q=bug+defect+enhancement&repository_id=64778136`<br><br>The labels that best match the query appear first in the search results.|
|[SearchRepos(q, sort=None, direction='desc', per\_page=30, page=1)](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.3/rest/reference/search#search-repositories)|Find repositories via various criteria.

For more details about how to receive highlighted search results, see [Text match metadata](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.3/rest/reference/search#text-match-metadata).<br><br>For example, if you want to search for popular Tetris repositories written in assembly code, your query might look like this:<br><br>`q=tetris+language:assembly&sort=stars&order=desc`<br><br>This query searches for repositories with the word `tetris` in the name, the description, or the README. The results are limited to repositories where the primary language is assembly. The results are sorted by stars in descending order, so that the most popular repositories appear first in the search results.|
|[SearchTopics(q, per\_page=30, page=1)](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.3/rest/reference/search#search-topics)|Find topics via various criteria. Results are sorted by best match.

For more details about how to receive highlighted search results, see [Text match metadata](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.3/rest/reference/search#text-match-metadata).<br><br>For example, if you want to search for topics related to Ruby that are featured on https://github.com/topics. Your query might look like this:<br><br>`q=ruby+is:featured`<br><br>This query searches for topics with the keyword `ruby` and limits the results to find only topics that are featured. The topics that are the best match for the query appear first in the search results.|
