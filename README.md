# Overview 

A python3 API for accessing github

# Authentication

Access tokens are generated by github at this link https://github.com/settings/tokens

# Installation

(Uploading to PyPi in the near future)

```bash
$ pip install --use-feature=in-tree-build .
```

# Usage

```python

ghc = GitHubClient(token=options.token)

ascii_art = ghc.MetaGetOctocat(options.text).data.decode('utf-8')
    
print(ascii_art)
    
print(f"rate-limit remaining={ghc.rateLimitRemaining}")

```

# Troubleshooting
## Intellisense not working in WingIDE
In order for intellisense to work under WingIDE, the 'main entry point' must import the githubpy package or import another package/module that does.   
### Corrective Action:
right click the file you wish to execute in the 'Project' tab/tool and select "Set as Main Entry Point".
